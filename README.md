Math Operators Object Detection 
Using TensorFlow Object Detection API open source structure makes it plausible to build, prepare and convey a custom item discovery model easily. The location model appeared above utilizations TensorFlow's API and distinguishes transcribed digits and basic numerical administrators. Likewise, the yield of the anticipated items (numbers and math administrators) are then assessed and settled. Right now, the model made above is restricted to essential math and direct polynomial math.
